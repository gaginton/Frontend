Paint Read Me

ITC assignment to create a Paint 95-esq program using Javascript and CSS. 
This program does not use canvas or canvas elements. 

Known issues: 
- Dynamic canvas and clear canvas break drawing functions. This is likely due to changes in the node causing issues with the javascript file. I am looking for a workaround.
- Save/load function are saving the canvas rather than the div/dot class. 
- Text button does not work.
- Toggle buttons should be ammended.
- Lag when changing shapes (border-radius). Cause of this is unknown. 

Potential things to add: 
- Smoothing function for drawing function
- Add images by url
