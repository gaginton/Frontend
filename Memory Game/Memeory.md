# Test Your Meme-ory
A take on the memory game using popular classic and new memes. This game was built using HTML, Javascript and CSS. The user can choose between 3 theme and 4 difficulty settings. 

Features:
- Tiles are dealt randomly, ensuring no memorization of patterns. 
- Dynamic sizing: Tiles take up 25% of their container. Bootstrap is used for guesses and timer to be in a grid on left and right side. 
- A message pop ups after the player wins providing number of guesses and run time.
- Functional buttons allow user to play a new game. 
- Responsive to different window sizes (mobile-friendly).
- Can not click on tiles after incorrect guess. 
- Press F at any time to restart game. User is prompted to press F upon winning or losing. 

To work on: 
- Simplify code. I had only 3 image arrays originally, but ran into problems with repeated game play. 
- Fix glitch where player clicks on 3 tiles too quickly. 
- Work on styling. Additional dynamic sizing. Add animations!
- Save and load.
